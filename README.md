## Introduction & project overview

For our project, we chose to focus on the reforestation of countries worldwide.
We identified datasets providing this information in percentage and in hectares per year.
To be able to combine these datasets, we found a table containing  for each country its code(referenced from an ISO norm), and its coordinates.
Discussing our business model, we decided to retrieve an extra one to have data about tourism,
and decided to work as a tourism agency, looking to expand into ecotourism and therefore need to find suitable locations to start building eco-tour packages

## Hypothesis

We chose two hypothesis:
We suspect countries with reforestation would be good for eco-tourists, so which countries worldwide are experiencing reforestation? 
Which of the most-visited countries are relevant for landuse in term of forests? â†’ Which of the reforested countries are among the most-visited countries?

## Datasets

Datasets:	
- https://gist.github.com/tadast/8827699
	Table:	country_codes	
	Information:	Countries names with their  (ISO 3166-1) codes and coordinates
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/deforestation-dataset	
	Table:	deforest_percent	
	Information:	Deforestation by comparison of percent of land as forest between 2000 and 2020
- https://data.apps.fao.org/catalog/dataset/forest-area-1990-2020-1000-ha/resource/3cc5000d-184c-4ebe-8e54-b71910111f12	
	Table:	forest_hectares	
	Information:	Hectares of forest by country
- https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-visited-countries	
	Table: top_visited	
	Information:	Number of persons (i.e. tourist) entering countries per year


## Data preparation and Analysis

The initial datasets were prepared to allow us to fit into our database,
allowing us to retrieve informations about visits and evolution of landuse by country.
Our database contains four tables, with three tables containing the countries information and one allowing us to join them.

### Main dataset issues

-	Difficulty in finding compatible datasets
-	Country names are not normalized across datasets
-	Missing and incomplete datasets  

### Solutions for the dataset issues

-	Sanitised datasets
-	Transformed datasets
-	Supplement datasets by joining

The database was then used to get a better understanding of our potential market.
The performed queries chosen were:
 - Finding the 10 most visited countries
 - Finding the 10 countries with the highest reforestation percent
 - Finding the 10 countries with the most forest per hectares
 - Retrieving data for displaying information on tourism in a heatmap
 - Retrieving data for displaying information on deforestation in a heatmap
 - Retrieving data for the 5 most and 5 least visited countries showing their re/deforestation percentages and number of tourists in 2020
 - Number of Tourist visits in our dataset
 - Finding Most reforestation effort vs most deforestation

## Conclusions
Our first hypothesis is validated as our data allowed us to identify countries reforesting their land while having insight on their tourism indistry.
